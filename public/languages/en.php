We never thought that we would be in a relationship or even married considering we only had known each other for a while and we did not have any friends in the same circle. We were brought together as an intern who needed thesis data and the data givers. There was nothing special between us until one day, we had a small conversation on Instagram after commenting on a Story. Since then, communication had become more intense and several months later we decided to start a relationship.
      Long story short, here we are now. In the name of Allah, we will start a new journey with a new status as husband and wife. The journey may not be going to be easy, but we hope that with Allah's permission, we can go through it all together in peace, calm, and serenity filled with love and compassion.",
